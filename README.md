Text Adventures!

## About

This is a text game and engine that I am writing just for fun. And to learn more about the basics of game programming. I loved 
playing games like Kings Quest when I was a kid and text adventures harken back to those days for me. 

Text games also remind me of a book I borrowed when I was a kid. It was a thick book full of BASIC code that you would type
in to the computer and then run it. When you ran the code, you had a full game! That was REAL open source because you had
to make the effort to type all 25 or 50 pages of code in, while the editor was hot. Makes you grateful for how far
we've come since then. :)

I'm going to continue updating the data files for the "Epic Adventure" so that the story gets bigger and bigger. But if 
you play the game, happen to like it, and have an idea, please feel free to contribute it. 

This project is all about fun so I'm always open to new ideas.
